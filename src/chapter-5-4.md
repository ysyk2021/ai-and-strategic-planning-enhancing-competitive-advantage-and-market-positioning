In this chapter, we'll focus on natural language processing (NLP) and text mining as AI-based strategic planning techniques and strategies. These tools enable organizations to analyze unstructured data, such as customer feedback and reviews, and gain insights into customer behavior and preferences.

Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing involves using AI technology to analyze human language. NLP can be used to understand customer feedback, sentiment analysis, and other forms of unstructured data. By analyzing customer feedback, organizations can gain insights into customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and develop more effective strategies for customer engagement and retention.

Text Mining

Text mining involves extracting valuable information from large volumes of text data. Text mining can be used to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior, as well as to monitor brand reputation and track competitors. By leveraging text mining, organizations can make data-driven decisions and develop more targeted marketing campaigns.
