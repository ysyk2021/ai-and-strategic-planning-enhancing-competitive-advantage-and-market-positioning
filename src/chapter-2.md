In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of strategic planning. Strategic planning is a critical process that enables organizations to set goals and objectives, determine the resources needed to achieve them, and develop appropriate strategies to reach their targets.

Overview of Strategic Planning

Strategic planning involves identifying an organization's strengths and weaknesses, analyzing market trends and customer behavior, and developing appropriate strategies to improve market positioning and gain a competitive advantage.

Traditional Approaches to Strategic Planning

Traditional approaches to strategic planning typically involve developing a plan that outlines specific goals and objectives, identifying the resources needed to achieve them, and developing appropriate strategies to reach those targets. These plans are often developed over a long period, involving extensive research and analysis.

Limitations and Challenges of Traditional Approaches
